# InformationVisualizationFinalProject

Final Project for Information Visualization 

Created an interactive visualization of the 2019 Stack overflow developer survey using D3. This visulization enables users to gain insights on how the software development industry differs around the world by displaying a world map that users can click on to bring up specific information about countries they are interested in. 

A demonstration of the visualization can be view here
